# Summary

This repository contains the datasets and the code corresponding to the paper "Which jobs are done from home? Evidence from the American Time Use Survey" by Hensvik, Le Barbanchon and Rathelot. 

# Datasets

The datasets that contain the share of hours worked at home by occupation and industry can be found [here](https://github.com/tlebarbanchon/home-working-ATUS/tree/master/data/output). 

# Scripts

The scripts required to compute the share of hours worked at home from the ATUS can be found [here](https://github.com/tlebarbanchon/home-working-ATUS/tree/master/do). The main script is the do-file [remote_work](https://github.com/tlebarbanchon/home-working-ATUS/blob/master/do/remote_work.do). Running these scripts require a recent version of Stata.
